The sun above was hot. There was no one nearby. I was waiting for someone I had not seen in a long time.
I waited for her for 10 minutes, ..20 minutes.., the dark clouds were slowly starting to gather in the sky.., a hour went by..,
3 hours..., now the sky was full of dark clouds. Then the first drop arrived .. tap.. I saw her at the edge..tap.. tap...
the drops continued...tap...tap.. she came near me first hesitant then she walked steadily. The drops gained consistent rhythm. 
She continued walking then embraced me. The droplets kissed my cracked skin, seeping into the crevices, quenching my thirst, rejuvenating me.
