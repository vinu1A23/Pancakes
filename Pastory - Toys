I was with my father, my small hands were held by his. We were walking around the market. We were here for buying a dress for me. 
We went from one shop to another. Father was an expert at analyzing quality of clothes. My gaze went to a toy shop. I had gone inside of it many times. 

My mind went to the past where I had forced my father to buy me a remote-controlled toy truck. I wondered what happened to it. Why did I not play with it anymore?\
Was it uglier than before from when I saw it in the shop? No, that can't be it. It should still look the same. Did it stop moving then? No, that was not it too. 
Then I came to realize what I had been trying to deny about myself. I grew tired of my toys. I didn't enjoy them anymore. 
But when I saw a Mecha on the glass window of the toy shop my heart raced again. Then I came to realize it was not that I did not enjoyed toys anymore, it was only my old toys which I did not enjoy anymore. 

That day I decided I will not focus on external of how they look or what they do, I will focus on what they meant to me. My toys became something which remind of my father, which makes me help others, which keeps me on the right path. Outward appearances don't matter, inward qualities and emotions do.
